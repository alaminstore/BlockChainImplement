                         Blockchain Implement(How Blockchain actually work)
                         
                         Programming Language :  javascript(runtime - Node.js)
                         Using Algorithm: POW,secp256k1,SHA256
                         Using Library: Elliptic

Procedure:

1. Create basic from of a blockchain
       a. create a blockchain with JSON format
	   b. Create Chain, that's include current hash and previous hash
       c.connect one block to another

2. Blockchain validation
       a. Blockchain is valid or not(block's hash and previous hash valu's combination check)
	   b. Not possible temper blockchain(If anyone try to temper the blockchain and then again recalculate hash)

3. Deploy POW(Proof of Work) algorithm
      a. Mining block(add block in blockchain)
	  b. Set difficulty in a hash value(000005454464648484.....)
	  c. Using Nonce value to change hash and makes it challenging for a miner to mine a block for adding the block in blockchain
	  d. By using difficulty, mine can take a interval for security purpose
	  
4. Set mining reward
      a. Why miner get interest to mine a block and get commission
      b. using crypto for reward system for miner
    
5. Set Wallet system
      a. By using elliptic for generating public and private key
      b. You are not eligible to sign for others wallet
      c. And after signin wallet woner can send coin to other address and also get reward
